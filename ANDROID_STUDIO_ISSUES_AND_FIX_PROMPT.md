# Android Studio Project Issues - Diagnostic Report

## Project Overview
This is an Android application that generates DOCX documents using Rust native libraries (via JNI) and Jetpack Compose for the UI. The app integrates Rust code compiled for Android architectures (ARM64 and ARMv7).

---

## Critical Issues Preventing Android Studio from Running the Project

### 1. **MISSING NATIVE LIBRARY LOADING** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Severity**: High - App will crash immediately on startup

**Problem**: The project has JNI native methods in Java classes but **NO `System.loadLibrary()` calls** anywhere in the codebase.

**Details**:
- Files like `AndroidDocBuilder.java`, `RustLog.java`, and `JNIReachabilityFence.java` declare native methods
- The native libraries `libdocx_lib.so` exist in `app/src/main/libs/{arch}/`
- **Missing**: A static initializer block to load the native library

**Expected Code** (currently missing):
```java
static {
    System.loadLibrary("docx_lib");
}
```

**Impact**: 
- `UnsatisfiedLinkError` when calling any native method
- App crashes immediately when trying to use `AndroidDocBuilder` or `RustLog`

---

### 2. **GRADLE VERSION MISMATCH** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Severity**: High - Causes build failures

**Problem**: Gradle wrapper is using version **8.9** but the Android Gradle Plugin is version **7.3.0**

**Files**:
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`: Gradle 8.9
- `build.gradle`: AGP 7.3.0

**Incompatibility**:
- Gradle 8.9 requires AGP 8.0+ minimum
- AGP 7.3.0 only supports Gradle 7.4-7.6

**Impact**:
- Build fails with compatibility errors
- Android Studio may not recognize the project structure properly

---

### 3. **OUTDATED DEPENDENCIES** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Severity**: Medium - Causes deprecation warnings and potential compatibility issues

**Problems**:
- **compileSdk/targetSdk 32** (API 32) - Current is API 35 (Android 15)
- **Kotlin 1.6.10** - Very outdated (current is 1.9.x / 2.0.x)
- **Compose 1.1.1** - Multiple versions behind
- **androidx.compose.material:material** - Using Material 2 instead of Material 3

**Impact**:
- Cannot use modern Android features
- Deprecated APIs and warnings
- Security vulnerabilities in old dependencies
- Poor IDE performance and IntelliSense issues

---

### 4. **GRADLE BUILD CONFIGURATION ERRORS**
**Severity**: Medium - Prevents successful builds

**Problem in `app/build.gradle:115`**:
```gradle
dependsOn: "cargo-output-dir-${arch}"
```
This task `cargo-output-dir-${arch}` is **never defined** in the build file.

**Impact**:
- Clean tasks will fail
- Gradle build fails when trying to clean

---

### 5. **INVALID SDK PATH IN local.properties**
**Severity**: Medium - Prevents builds on different machines

**Problem**:
```properties
sdk.dir=D\:\\Users\\James Njoroge\\AppData\\Local
```

**Issues**:
- This path is **NOT** the Android SDK directory
- Points to a user's AppData folder
- Wrong on any other machine/user account
- Should point to Android SDK root (e.g., `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`)

**Impact**:
- "SDK not found" errors
- Cannot build the project

---

### 6. **MISSING x86/x86_64 NATIVE LIBRARIES**
**Severity**: Low-Medium - Cannot run on emulators

**Problem**:
- `ndk.abiFilters` declares support for: `'armeabi-v7a','arm64-v8a','x86','x86_64'`
- Only ARM libraries exist in `app/src/main/libs/`
- No x86/x86_64 `.so` files

**Impact**:
- Cannot run on x86-based Android emulators
- Most developers use x86_64 emulators by default
- App will crash on emulator with `UnsatisfiedLinkError`

---

### 7. **OBSOLETE BUILD TOOLS**
**Severity**: Low-Medium

**Issues**:
- Using deprecated `annotationProcessor` alongside `kapt`
- Old Room version (2.4.3, current is 2.6+)
- No Gradle Kotlin DSL (still using Groovy)

---

## Summary of Build Failures

When attempting to run in Android Studio, you would encounter:

1. ‚úó **Gradle sync fails** due to version incompatibility
2. ‚úó **SDK path errors** if on different machine
3. ‚úó **Missing task errors** during clean
4. ‚úó **Runtime crash** with `UnsatisfiedLinkError` (no library loading)
5. ‚úó **Cannot run on emulator** (missing x86 libraries)

# üîß PROMPT TO TRIGGER CLAUDE TO FIX ALL ISSUES

---

## Copy and paste this prompt to Claude:

```
I have an Android application that uses Rust native libraries via JNI and won't run in Android Studio. Please analyze and fix ALL the following critical issues:

1. **Add native library loading**: The app has native methods but no System.loadLibrary() calls. Add static blocks to load "docx_lib" in the appropriate Java classes (AndroidDocBuilder.java, RustLog.java, JNIReachabilityFence.java).

2. **Fix Gradle version mismatch**: 
   - Gradle wrapper is 8.9 but AGP is 7.3.0 (incompatible)
   - Upgrade to AGP 8.7.0, Kotlin 1.9.25, and ensure Gradle 8.9 compatibility

3. **Update all outdated dependencies**:
   - Upgrade compileSdk and targetSdk from 32 to 35
   - Update Compose from 1.1.1 to latest stable
   - Migrate from Material 2 to Material 3
   - Update Room, AndroidX libraries, and all dependencies to latest stable versions
   - Update Compose compiler version to match Kotlin version

4. **Fix Gradle build errors**:
   - Remove the undefined "cargo-output-dir-${arch}" task dependency from clean tasks
   - Fix the clean task configuration in app/build.gradle

5. **Fix SDK path issue**:
   - The local.properties has an invalid SDK path pointing to AppData instead of Android SDK
   - Update it to the correct Windows Android SDK path or document how to set it

6. **Handle missing x86 libraries**:
   - Since x86/x86_64 libraries don't exist, remove them from ndk.abiFilters
   - Add a comment explaining only ARM architectures are supported

7. **Modernize build configuration**:
   - Remove duplicate annotationProcessor (already using kapt)
   - Update build features and options for modern Android development
   - Add any missing Gradle configuration for Jetpack Compose

Please make all necessary changes to:
- build.gradle (root)
- app/build.gradle
- local.properties
- All Java files in com.example.docxgenerator.lib package
- Any other files that need updates

After making changes, verify the project can:
‚úì Sync successfully in Android Studio
‚úì Build without errors
‚úì Run on ARM-based devices/emulators
‚úì Load native libraries correctly

Deploy all fixes now and ensure the project is fully functional.
```
